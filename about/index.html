<p>
My name is Mark Hutchinson and I was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. I grew up on a farm outside of Paris, Ontario which is where I attended high school.   
</p>

<p>
I studied Computer Science at the University of Waterloo where I was in the co-operative education program.  This meant that I alternated between academic semesters and work terms every four months.  This gave me the opportunity to work at a variety of different companies like IBM, Blackberry  (Formerly RIM), and Tira Wireless  (now defunct).   Immediately after graduating I moved to Toronto where I worked at IBM Canada for a bit more than three years.
</p>

<p>
I currently live in San Francisco, California in a neighbourhood called Lower Haight with my wife Katie and our dog Stuckey.   I am working as a Senior Software engineer at Zynga on FarmVille 2.
