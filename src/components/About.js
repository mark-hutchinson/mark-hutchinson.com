              <p>Hi! I’m a software developer living in Toronto, Canada. I develop games played by millions of people at Zynga. I’ve been described as curious, empathetic and hardworking.</p>
              <p>My wife <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/katie-hutchinson-9666a388/">Katie</a> is the executive director of <a href="https://vibearts.ca/donate/">VIBE Arts</a>, a charitable organization dedicated to providing children and youth in under-resourced communities with arts education. We have an adorable dog named Stuckey.</p>
              <p>I studied Computer Science at the University of Waterloo where I was in the co-operative education program. This gave me the opportunity to have internships at a variety of different companies like IBM and Blackberry. After graduating I worked at IBM for 3 years before moving to San Francisco to start at Zynga. In 2014 I relocated back to Toronto to work at <a href="https://www.zynga.com/international-location/toronto-canada/">Zynga Toronto</a>. We're always growing so reach out to me if you want to join!</p>
              <p>I love travelling, getting outside, learning new things, urban design, craft beer, and strong coffee.</p>
